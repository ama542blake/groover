# General
- [ ] Figure out how to set the project up to support type checking (select one of the options below)
  - [ ] Pyright: https://github.com/microsoft/pyright/blob/main/docs/getting-started.md
  - [ ] MyPy: https://mypy-lang.org/
- [ ] Devise structure for project: https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/structure/
  - [ ] Fit existing things within this structure

# Generation
- [ ] Devise new, more concise syntax for specifying groups of notes (e.g., "sk" might mean snare and kick happening at the same time)
  - [ ] Document the syntax
  - [ ] Add functions to parse these strings into PercussionChord objects

# Extraction
<ul>
    <li>More fully flesh out the concept of <code>Transformer</code>s and <code>Extractor</code>s. Isthere some kind of hierarchical relationship here that could potentially be turned into a polymorphic class structure?</li>
    <li>Find a test framework</li>
</ul>
