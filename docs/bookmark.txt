*This file explains the current state of the project. In other words, it explains
where I'm leaving off so that I know what's going on when I pick it back up. It should
be updated each time I complete a session of work on the project.

1/15/24:
- Updates were just done that fixed some major issues with parsing the file's preamble.

- There are some lingering issues with errors such as:
    "token recognition error at: '\n'"
which makes no sense because the NEWLINE rule should recognize and discard this. As
far as I can tell, each of the characters that cause this error should be recognizable.

- Need to refactor some of the rules from PreambleLexer into a common Lexer token file.
Rules such as NAMED_ITEM, or INT may be more generally useful.

- I am having trouble with recognition of the timeSignature parser rule. It seems that
INTs can't be matched. Along with this, I am unable to successfully parse a name which
is an int - such as "TITLE: 5", but this should be considered valid.
