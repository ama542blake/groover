*This file explains the current state of the project. In other words, it explains
where I'm leaving off so that I know what's going on when I pick it back up. It should
be updated each time I complete a session of work on the project.Ã¥

1/28/24:
- Fixed token recognition issues by removing lexical mode
- Updated the test-preamble script to be able to take arguments for start rule and test file,
  both of which are optional.
- Next things that should be done are adding this functionality to other testing
  scripts, and moving these scripts to their own directory.
