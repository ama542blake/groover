*This file explains the current state of the project. In other words, it explains
where I'm leaving off so that I know what's going on when I pick it back up. It should
be updated each time I complete a session of work on the project. This is also different
from TODOS.md, which consider what needs to be done in the long-term. Next steps listed
in this file are much shorter-term (will be addressed in the next few working sessions).

1/30/24:
- Started cleaning up the file structure for grammars/scripts. Not everything has been moved
  around yet - I'll put things in their places as I get to checking them for correctness/relevance.
- Next steps:
  - Add more preamble tests
  - Check how necessary other scripts are, and update them to...
    - Reflect the updated file structure
    - Accept options/arguments as needed
  - Find better place for independent_parser_runner.py
- The scripts are way too reliant on relative paths. It might be useful to add a configuration file
  or scripts (or maybe even one of the start up scripts) to define these paths in system variables
  so that all paths can be written absolutely.
