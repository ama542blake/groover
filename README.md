#Groover
Notating drum music in a conventional music editing program can be cumbersome.
A simpler way to notate music is with tabs, where you just write out grooves in text.
While I appreciate the simplicity of drum tabs, and how easy it is to notate grooves,
it's not as powerful as actual sheet music. But inputting drum set parts in a sheet
music editor can be cumbersome and clunky.

This project is attempting to solve this problem- or at least explore the possibility.
As someone who finds both drumming and the design of programming languages intriguing,
this is my attempt to combine the two things.

While I am designing this primarily with my needs in mind, if you would like to try
it out and give me feedback, please feel free to <a href="mailto:ama542blake@gmail.com">email me</a>.
